# Run That Shellcode!

This repository and all the code contained in it is part of my learning experience as I go through [RED TEAM Operator: Malware Development Essentials Course](https://institute.sektor7.net/view/courses/red-team-operator-malware-development-essentials/) try to obfuscate as much of the code as possible.

## Test 1 - The Raw Code

- The executable was produced from direct code, i.e., no obfuscation methods were employed what so ever. The function calls and the payloads were kept intact without any funny business.
